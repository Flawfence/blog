# How to Choose a Vulnerability Scan in 2025?

## Introduction

In 2025, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve rapidly, making the choice of a vulnerability scanning tool **crucial for protecting systems and data**.

However, there are numerous tools on the market, each with its own features and benefits. This can be particularly confusing!

Which one to choose? In what context? For what type of scan? For what type of system?

We shed light on the subject in this article.

## A Bit of History

The origin of vulnerability scans dates back to the early days of computing when the first networks were established. At that time, security was often neglected, making systems highly vulnerable.

Vulnerability scans emerged in the **1990s** with tools like `SATAN: Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks`. Over the decades, these tools have evolved to become more sophisticated, integrating constantly updated vulnerability databases and advanced analysis capabilities.

In **1999**, the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** system was introduced to standardize the identification and sharing of vulnerabilities. This initiative facilitated communication among security professionals by providing a common nomenclature for known vulnerabilities.

Most vulnerability scanning tools today are based on this nomenclature.

## How Does a Vulnerability Scan Work?

A vulnerability scan is an automated process that analyzes a system, network, or application for security flaws.

### Key Steps

It generally involves several steps:

1. **Discovery**: The tool identifies the assets to be analyzed, such as servers, applications, and databases.
2. **Analysis**: The tool performs a series of tests to detect potential vulnerabilities. This can include penetration tests, configuration analyses, and compliance checks.
3. **Report**: The tool generates a report detailing the detected vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for remediation.

Vulnerability scans are often confused with automated penetration tests. Although the two processes share similarities, they have different objectives.

### Vulnerability Scans vs. Automated Penetration Tests

It is important to note that a vulnerability scan is different from an automated penetration test. Although the two processes share similarities, they have different objectives.

- **Vulnerability Scan**: This is an automated analysis aimed at identifying security flaws in a system or network. The primary goal is to detect known vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.
- **Automated Penetration Tests**: These simulate real attacks on a system to assess its resistance to threats. These tests are generally more in-depth and can include advanced exploitation techniques.

There are modern tools like **Flawfence** that combine both approaches. They perform both **vulnerability scans** and **automated penetration tests**, offering a comprehensive solution for system security.

## Why Is It Important to Choose the Right Vulnerability Scan?

Choosing the right vulnerability scanning tool is essential for several reasons:

- **Data Protection**: An effective scan helps detect vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers.
- **Compliance**: Many regulations, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, require companies to regularly perform vulnerability scans to ensure data security.
- **Cost Reduction**: Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities early in the development cycle can significantly reduce costs associated with data breaches and security incidents.

In short, a good vulnerability scan is an essential investment for any organization concerned about its security.

## Some Tools

![Vulnerability Scan](/images/quel-scan-de-vulnérabilité-utiliser-en-2025/1.png)
